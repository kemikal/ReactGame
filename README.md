# Reaction Game
A simple console based reaction game that waits for a random time and then waits for the user to press a key as fast as possible.

## xUnit tests
The project contains a set of xUnit tests that test the functionality of the game.

## next steps
The game has test for a millisecond formatter but the formatter is not implemented yet. Implement the formatter.
